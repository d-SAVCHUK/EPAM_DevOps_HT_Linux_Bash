## The home task for the topic "Linux + Bash"

# Task 1. Create a script that uses the following keys:

1. When starting without parameters, it will display a list of possible keys and their description.
2. The --all key displays the IP addresses and symbolic names of all hosts in the current subnet.
3. The --target key displays a list of open system TCP ports.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#HT #1 Dmytro SAVCHUK

# function to display list of possible keys and their descriptions
display_help() {
    echo "List of possible keys:"
    echo "--all : Displays the IP addresses and symbolic names of all hosts in the current subnet"
    echo "--target : Displays a list of open system TCP ports"
}

# function to display IP addresses and symbolic names of all hosts in current subnet
display_all() {
    arp -a
}

# function to display a list of open system TCP ports
display_target() {
    netstat â€“at   # t - TCP ports
}

# check if no arguments were provided
if [ $# -eq 0 ]; then
    display_help
    exit 1
fi

# process the provided keys
while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
    key="$1"
    case $key in
        --all)
            display_all
            shift
            ;;
        --target)
            display_target
            shift
            ;;
        *)
            echo "Invalid key: $key"
            display_help
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac

# Task 2. Using Apache log example create a script to answer the following questions:

1. From which ip were the most requests?
2. What is the most requested page?
3. How many requests were there from each ip?
4. What non-existent pages were clients referred to? 
5. What time did site get the most requests?
6. What search bots have accessed the site? (UA + IP)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#HT #2 Dmytro SAVCHUK

# Function to show all possible parameters
show_parameters() {

# Task 3. Create a data backup script that takes the following data as parameters:

1. Path to the syncing directory.
2. The path to the directory where the copies of the files will be stored.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

#HT #3 Dmytro SAVCHUK

# Display a message indicating that the script is checking the internet status
